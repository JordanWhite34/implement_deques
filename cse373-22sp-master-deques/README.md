Deque (usually pronounced like “deck”) is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. They are special queues (or, equally valid, special stacks) that you can add and remove from either its front or its back.

In this project, we will compare two implementations of a deque. This project shows demonstration of:

Understing the difference between an ADT and a data structure.
Understing data structure invariants and their value in testing programs.
Practicing debugging code using tests.
